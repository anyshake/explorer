## Overview

AnyShake Explorer uses three velocity geophones (EHZ, EHE, EHN) to detect the seismic waves generated by the earthquake, the geophone is a device that converts ground movement into voltage. This solution is more sensitive than most existing homemade seismograph based on MPU6050.

AnyShake Explorer consists of ADC, MCU, and RS232 serial port. The ADC which has at least 6 channels, more than 24-bit resolution, is configured as differential input, it is used to read the geophone voltage count. The ADC is connected to the MCU via SPI protocol. The MCU is responsible for collecting data from the ADC and sending it to [AnyShake Observer](https://github.com/anyshake/observer) via RS232 serial port.

AnyShake Explorer is open-source and provides schematics and PCB layout that you can use directly. In the future we plan to add a signal conditioning circuit between the Geophone and the ADC for better performance.

## Credits

AnyShake Explorer is designed and developed by [@bclswl0827](https://github.com/bclswl0827), test work is done by [@TenkyuChimata](https://github.com/TenkyuChimata).

Thanks to the following tools and libraries, AnyShake Explorer is made possible!

- [KiCad EDA](https://kicad.org/)
- [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/)

*Some may ask why we didn't use Arduino IDE, the reason is that Arduino IDE is not suitable for large projects, and it is not easy to manage dependencies. PlatformIO is a cross-platform IDE that supports Arduino, and it is also a package manager for Arduino libraries. It is very suitable for large projects.*
